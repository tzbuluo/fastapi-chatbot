## Implementation approach:
We will use Python for the entire stack due to its simplicity and extensive libraries. For data cleaning, we will use `pandas` to process the CSV files and filter out non-text messages. For API integration, we will use the `requests` library to interact with the Tencent Cloud DeepSeek API. For the web service, we will use `FastAPI` due to its performance and ease of use. Protopie integration will be handled by configuring HTTP components to call our FastAPI service.

## Data structures and interfaces:
classDiagram
    class DataProcessor {
        +process_csv(file_path: str) -> dict
    }
    class DeepSeekAPI {
        +train_model(data: dict) -> str
        +generate_response(session_id: str, model_id: str, user_input: str) -> dict
    }
    class ChatAPI {
        +handle_chat_request(request: ChatRequest) -> dict
    }
    DataProcessor --> DeepSeekAPI
    ChatAPI --> DeepSeekAPI

## Program call flow:
sequenceDiagram
    participant DP as DataProcessor
    participant DS as DeepSeekAPI
    participant CA as ChatAPI
    participant P as Protopie
    DP->>DS: train_model(data)
    DS-->>DP: model_id
    P->>CA: handle_chat_request(request)
    CA->>DS: generate_response(session_id, model_id, user_input)
    DS-->>CA: response
    CA-->>P: response

## Anything UNCLEAR:
Clarification needed on the exact fields required for the Protopie integration and any additional data fields for model training.
